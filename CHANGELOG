# hubdown changelog

## V 0.0.12
No longer hard_wraps a line break

## V 0.0.11
Support for multibyte chars in the template (Thx to @kitak!)
Fix bug where needed cached files could potentially be deleted

## V 0.0.10

### Add syntax highlighting
Switch away from using the `github-markdown` gem. Instead it now uses
[`redcarpet`](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet) and
[`pygments.rb`](https://github.com/tmm1/pygments.rb). This adds fenced code
syntax highlighting for most langauges that github currently supports (maybe
all of them).


## V 0.0.9

### Stylesheet caching
Now caches the scraped css that it pulls from github. This allows you to
continue working with hubdown even when offline.

### Removes erroneous `pry` dependency
